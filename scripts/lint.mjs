/**
 * Run biome against a binary that actually works on this host.
 *
 * Everywhere except Windows ARM64 this is a thin passthrough to the platform
 * binary npm installed. On Windows ARM64 it provisions the x64 build OF THE
 * SAME VERSION into a gitignored cache and runs that under emulation instead.
 *
 * Why: SOME `@biomejs/cli-win32-arm64` builds are broken, and which ones is not
 * predictable from the version number. Measured on this win32-arm64 host
 * (2026-09-11), including the binary invoked directly with no npm in the
 * picture:
 *
 *   2.4.16   runs correctly -- exit 0 on a clean tree, exit 1 naming the file
 *            on a deliberately broken one
 *   2.5.4    exit 139 / STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION 0xC0000005 on CHECK-shaped
 *            runs, and the same through the `.bin/biome` shim and `biome.cmd`
 *            from PowerShell. It answers `--version` with exit 0, so "the
 *            binary starts" is not evidence that `check` will survive.
 *   2.5.13   runs correctly
 *
 * So this is neither a permanent arm64 defect nor a fault in npm's run-script
 * wrapper: it is a per-version packaging bug in the arm64 executable. An
 * earlier revision of this comment claimed the arm64 binary segfaults on every
 * invocation path, and that `npx biome` silently skips files it cannot process.
 * Both were measured FALSE -- do not reinstate them.
 *
 * The x64 build of every version measured runs fine under Windows' x64
 * emulation -- including 2.5.4, whose arm64 sibling is the broken one -- and
 * produces an authoritative result. So the honest purpose of this script is
 * narrow: when the native binary for THIS host is unusable, run the x64 build
 * of the version the repo actually installs. The routing is unconditional on
 * Windows ARM64 rather than gated on a probe, for the `--version` reason above;
 * `YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1` opts back into the platform binary on any host,
 * which is correct on every version whose arm64 build is unaffected.
 *
 * Why this is a script and not a devDependency: npm refuses to install
 * `@biomejs/cli-win32-x64` on an arm64 host (EBADPLATFORM), which is precisely
 * the situation we are working around, so it cannot be declared normally. The
 * install below passes `--force` for that reason and `--no-save` so the
 * workaround never leaks into package.json.
 *
 * Why it matters here specifically: this repo has no CI -- there is no
 * .github/workflows directory, and GitHub Actions is disabled on YawLabs/mcp
 * (checked 2026-09-11) -- so there is no runner to arbitrate formatting later.
 * `release.sh` step 1 runs `npm run lint`, and whatever this script reports
 * there is the ONLY lint signal that exists before it publishes to npm.
 *
 * Escape hatches, in case the platform assumption ages badly:
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_BIN=<path>   use exactly this binary, skip all detection
 *   YAWLABS_BIOME_NATIVE=1     force the normal platform binary on any host
